              <li>Basic information and Why it happened</li>
            <p>Wildfires are large, uncontrolled fires that occur in areas with vegetation, such as forests, grasslands, and urban areas. They can be caused by natural factors such as lightning, or human activities such as campfires, cigarettes, and fireworks.
                <br>
                They can spread quickly and unpredictably, and can cause significant damage to homes, wildlife, and human life.
        </p>


              <li>Prevention Advice</li>
            <p>To prevent wildfires, it's important to follow any local regulations and restrictions on outdoor burning, and to use caution when handling flammable materials such as cigarettes, campfires, and fireworks.
                <br>
                It's also important to properly maintain your property by clearing dead leaves, branches, and other debris, and to create a defensible space around your home to help prevent fires from spreading.
        </p>
            
              <li>Damage to the Body</li>
            <p>Wildfires can cause a range of injuries, from minor cuts and bruises to more serious injuries such as burns, smoke inhalation, and carbon monoxide poisoning. In severe cases, wildfires can result in loss of life.</p>
              
              <li>What to Do </li>
              <p>If you are in an area affected by a wildfire, it's important to take the following steps:</p>
              <ol>
                  <li>Follow any evacuation orders issued by local authorities, and move to a safe location outside the affected area.</li>
                  <li>If you are unable to evacuate, seek shelter in a building with closed windows and doors, and use a damp cloth to cover your nose and mouth to protect against smoke and ash.</li>
                  <li>If you are caught outside during a wildfire, try to find a body of water, such as a pond or river, and immerse yourself in it if possible.</li>
                  <li>After the wildfire has passed, be cautious of potential hazards such as unstable ground, hot spots, and damaged power lines.</li>
                  <li>After the flood has subsided, be cautious of potential hazards such as downed power lines, contaminated water, and damaged buildings.</li>
                  <li>Seek medical attention if you or someone else is injured during the wildfire.</li>
                </ol>
                <br>
            <p>It's important to follow any instructions provided by local authorities during a wildfire, and to stay informed about any ongoing risks or hazards in your area.
                <br>
                Taking appropriate precautions and being prepared can help minimize the risk of injury or
                harm during a wildfire.
