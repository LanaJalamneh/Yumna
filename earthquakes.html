              <li>Basic information and Why it happened</li>
            <p>Earthquakes are caused by the movement of tectonic plates beneath the Earth's surface. They can occur suddenly and without warning, and can cause significant damage to buildings, infrastructure, and human life.</p>


              <li>Prevention Advice</li>
            <p>Preventing earthquakes is not possible, but there are steps you can take to prepare for them. These include securing heavy objects and furniture to prevent them from falling or causing injury during an earthquake, and creating an emergency plan
                with your family or household that includes procedures for evacuating, locating each other, and accessing emergency supplies.
        </p>
            
              <li>Damage to the Body</li>
            <p>Earthquakes can cause a range of injuries, from minor cuts and bruises to more serious injuries such as broken bones, head trauma, and crush injuries. In severe cases, earthquakes can result in loss of life.</p>
            
            
              <li>What to Do </li>
            <p>If you are in an earthquake, it's important to take the following steps:</p>

              <ol>
                  <li>Drop to the ground, take cover under a sturdy desk or table, and hold on until the shaking stops.</li>
                  <li>If you are unable to take cover under a desk or table, crouch down against an interior wall and cover your head and neck with your arms.</li>
                  <li>Stay away from windows, shelves, and other objects that could fall and cause injury.</li>
                  <li>If you are indoors, do not try to exit the building during the earthquake.</li>
                  <li>If you are outdoors, move away from buildings, streetlights, and other structures that could fall and cause injury.</li>
                  <li>After the earthquake has stopped, check yourself and others for injuries, and provide first aid as necessary.</li>
                  <li>Follow any instructions provided by local authorities, including evacuation orders, and be prepared for aftershocks.</li>
                </ol>
                <br>
            <p>It's important to seek medical attention if you or someone else is injured during an earthquake, and to continue to monitor the situation for any additional hazards or risks, such as gas leaks or fires.</p>
