              <li>Basic information and Why it happened</li>
            <p>Floods occur when water overflows its normal boundaries, often due to heavy rain, snowmelt, or coastal storms. They can be sudden and unpredictable, and can cause significant damage to buildings, infrastructure, and human life.</p>

              <li>Prevention Advice</li>
            <p>To prevent flood-related injuries, it's important to take precautions before a flood occurs, such as securing your home and belongings, and creating an emergency plan with your family or household that includes procedures for evacuation, locating
                each other, and accessing emergency supplies.
                <br>
                It's also important to stay informed about flood risks in your area, and to follow any warnings or advisories issued by local authorities.
        </p>
            
              <li>Damage to the Body</li>
<p>Floods can cause a range of injuries, from minor cuts and bruises to more serious injuries such as broken bones, head trauma, and drowning. In severe cases, floods can result in loss of life.</p>            
            
              <li>What to Do </li>
            <p>If you are in a flood, it's important to take the following steps:</p>

              <ol>
                  <li>Follow any evacuation orders issued by local authorities, and move to higher ground if possible.</li>
                  <li>Avoid walking or driving through floodwater, which can be deeper and more dangerous than it appears.</li>
                  <li>If you must walk through floodwater, use a stick to check the depth and flow of the water, and wear sturdy, waterproof shoes.</li>
                  <li>If you are trapped in a building during a flood, move to the highest level and wait for rescue, signaling for help if possible.</li>
                  <li>After the flood has subsided, be cautious of potential hazards such as downed power lines, contaminated water, and damaged buildings.</li>
                  <li>Seek medical attention if you or someone else is injured during the flood.</li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <p>It's important to follow any instructions provided by local authorities during a flood, and to stay informed about any ongoing risks or hazards in your area. 
                    <br>
                    Taking appropriate precautions and being prepared can help minimize the risk of injury or harm
                    during a flood.
