              <li>Basic information and Why it happened</li>
            <p>Hurricanes and Typhoons are large, powerful storms that develop over warm ocean waters. They are caused by a combination of factors, including warm water temperatures, low wind shear, and atmospheric instability.
                <br>
                These storms can cause high
                winds, heavy rainfall, storm surges, and flooding, and can be very dangerous for those in their path.
        </p>


              <li>Prevention Advice</li>
            <p>To prepare for a hurricane or typhoon, it's important to have an emergency plan in place, including an evacuation plan and an emergency supply kit.
                <br>
                Stay informed about any potential storms by monitoring local weather reports and alerts, and follow
                any evacuation orders issued by local authorities.
        </p>
            
              <li>Damage to the Body</li>
            <p>Hurricanes and typhoons can cause a range of injuries, from minor cuts and bruises to more serious injuries such as broken bones, head injuries, and drowning. In severe cases, these storms can result in loss of life.</p>
              
              <li>What to Do </li>
            <p>If you are in an area affected by a hurricane or typhoon, it's important to take the following steps:</p>
            
              <ol>
                 <li>Follow any evacuation orders issued by local authorities, and move to a safe location outside the affected area.</li>
                 <li>If you are unable to evacuate, seek shelter in a sturdy building, and stay away from windows and doors.</li>
                 <li>Be prepared for power outages and other disruptions by having an emergency supply kit with food, water, and other essentials.</li>
                 <li>After the storm has passed, be cautious of potential hazards such as downed power lines, damaged buildings, and flooded areas.</li>
                 <li>Seek medical attention if you or someone else is injured during the storm.</li>
                </ol>
                <br>
            <p>It's important to stay informed about any ongoing risks or hazards in your area during a hurricane or typhoon, and to follow any instructions provided by local authorities. 
                <br>
                Taking appropriate precautions and being prepared can help minimize the risk of
                injury or harm during these powerful storms.
